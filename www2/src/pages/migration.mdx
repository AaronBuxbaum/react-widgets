# Migrating to v5

## Breaking Changes

### Naming Changes

- `valueField` -> `dataKey`

### SelectList has been removed

`SelectList` has always been an awkward component that was half checkbox/radio group,
half listbox component. Checkbox/radio group inputs are actually fairly simple
to build with plain ol react and native inputs, you don't need special focus handling
and mapping values to data is usually app specific. On the other hand RW has never
had a proper Listbox implementation that was public, and may folks hacked the SelectList
to fit that need. So in v5 we've removed SelectList and added `Listbox` input.


### (Date)TimePicker time selection

A new `TimeInput` has been added for time only values.

### Filtering differences

In order to simplify and streamline the RW API, we've removed some API niceties
that took up space and added complexity and easier left to the user to implement if needed.

One of these things is for inputs that support filtering: dropdown, multiselect, combobox.
We have removed a few of the built-in filtering options. in particular:

- `caseSensitive`
- `minLength`
- All filter preset values _besides_ 'eq', 'contains', 'startsWith'

These are all implemented by providing a function for filter

```jsx
<DropdownList
  filter={(item, searchValue = "") =>
    searchValue.length < 2 ||
    searchValue.startsWith(item.name)
  }
/>
```
