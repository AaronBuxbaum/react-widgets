A `<Listbox>` represents a list of selectable options. Single or multiple options can
be selected based on the situation.

## Overview

The `<Listbox>` component is visually similar to the native `<select>` element with a
`size` attribute provided. Like the native element, it can be used to select a single
option from a list or multiple.

For single options, selection follows the `<select>` behavior of not allowing deselection
once an item is chosen, only switching to another item.

```jsx
import Listbox from "react-widgets/lib/Listbox";

<fieldset>
  <legend>Select a color</legend>
  <Listbox
    defaultValue="Yellow"
    data={["Red", "Yellow", "Blue", "Orange"]}
  />
</fieldset>;
```

### Multiple

Add the `multiple` prop to allow toggling more than one item. In multiselect mode
items default to toggling their selected state on click, or keyboard selection

```jsx
import Listbox from "react-widgets/lib/Listbox";

<fieldset>
  <legend>Select a color</legend>
  <Listbox
    multiple
    defaultValue={["Yellow", "Orange"]}
    data={["Red", "Yellow", "Blue", "Orange"]}
  />
</fieldset>;
```
