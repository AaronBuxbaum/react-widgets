title: Migrating to v5
---

## Breaking Changes

### Naming Changes

- `valueField` -> `dataKey`

### SelectList has been removed

`SelectList` has always been an awkward component that was half checkbox/radio group,
half listbox component. Checkbox/radio group inputs are actually fairly simple
to build with plain ol react and native inputs, you don't need special focus handling
and mapping values to data is usually app specific. On the other hand RW has never
had a proper Listbox implementation that was public, and may folks hacked the SelectList
to fit that need. So in v5 we've removed SelectList and added `Listbox` input.

### DateTimePicker

The Date picker component has changed it's UX substantially to a single
popup with the calendar, and optionally time input.

Using the picker for both date and time has been soft deprecated (supported but not recommended).
In general, unstructured date and time input is not great UX. We recommend
using two inputs together, instead.

- `DateTimePicker` has been renamed to just `DatePicker` and does not support time values by default
  The `includeTime` can be used to enable time picking

- An experimental `TimeInput` has been added for time only values.
- the `parse` prop only accepts a single format (not an array of formats) or a function

### Filtering differences

In order to simplify and streamline the RW API, we've removed some API niceties
that took up space and added complexity and easier left to the user to implement if needed.

One of these things is for inputs that support filtering: dropdown, multiselect, combobox.
We have removed a few of the built-in filtering options. in particular:

- `caseSensitive`
- `minLength`
- All filter preset values _besides_ 'eq', 'contains', 'startsWith'

These can are all be reimplemented by providing a function for the filter prop:

```jsx
<DropdownList
  filter={(item, searchValue = "") =>
    searchValue.length < 2 ||
    searchValue.startsWith(item.name)
  }
/>
```

## Localizers

### Removed browser dist builds

We've removed the browser dist builds, they are too much trouble to maintain
and add very little value now-a-days. Please bundle yourself with webpack, parcel, et al.

### Provider based specification

Rather than have a bespoke configuration approach for localizers there is now
a `<Localization>` provider component that accepts a date and/or number localizer,
and provides them to each widget in the react component tree.

If no localizer is set the default `Intl` based one will be used.

## Styling

Less has been removed replaces fully by Sass.
